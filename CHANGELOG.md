# Changelog

All notable changes to Blinter are documented in this file. Release tags follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Pinned batch-spec to v0.72.8

## [1.1.71] - 2026-11-14

### Fixed

- E010 reports a FOR that starts after `&`, `&&`, `||`, or `|` on a caret-joined line, such as `echo ready & ^` followed by `for %%A in (a) echo %%A`. A space before `for` is still escaped, so that word is not a FOR command. `2>&1` stays a redirection
- E001 and E040 no longer treat `(` after `echo ^`, or after `do echo`, as a block parenthesis. That includes an indented `(` on the next line. `do (`, `else if`, and a real IF or FOR block parenthesis are unchanged
- A `"` escaped by the previous line's caret does not open a quote, so E009 stays quiet and the block scan still sees the rest of the command. A label ending in `^` still owns the following lines when one starts with `"`. `r^` / `em` is still a remark, so a later `)` is not E001
- `do rem` on a continued FOR is a remark, so the group after it is not E001. `if 1==1 (^` followed by `rem note)` keeps that `)` inside the remark
- E010 no longer reports a caret-joined FOR whose DO keyword is on a later physical line. That includes a FOR /F backquoted command, a list value that looks like `rem` and continues with another caret, a DO keyword split as `d^` / `o`, and a FOR keyword split as `f^` / `or` when the set continues with `(`
- DO has to be the first token after the IN set: `do` inside the set, `echo do`, and `do(` without a space do not count. An apostrophe in `O'Brien` or at the start of `'Brien`, a backtick, and a `)` inside `"a)b"` or `"a""b)c"` do not hide that DO
- The first character of each continued line is escaped, so `do^` followed by a space and `echo`, or by `(`, `)`, `"`, or `^`, and `& rem` are not syntax. A later `& rem` on that continued line still ends the command, as does `do rem` once the joined FOR is read as one command, including when DO is split as `d^` / `o rem`
- `(rem` inside the set is list text, not a remark. An extra `(` in the set does not nest, so `do rem` after that `)` still ends the command, including when `rem` is split across carets as `r^` / `e^` / `m`. A remark that mentions `in (...)` is still a remark
- A quoted `) do rem` inside the set is a value, so that caret still joins, including when the quote is on the FOR's first line. A `)` inside a FOR /F backtick command still closes the set. A FOR that still has no DO after those lines are joined is still E010

### Changed

- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.71

## [1.1.70] - 2026-11-13

### Fixed

- `browstat`, `inuse`, and `streams` are not reported as removed Windows commands (E034). They were never stock cmd commands. Pinned batch-spec to v0.72.7
- A FOR whose list or backquoted command continues onto the next line with `^` closes its parenthesis there. E001 no longer reports it unclosed, and the lines below it are no longer read as inside the loop or a block (P019, P022, P023, E043, W001, W052, W059). After a label line ending in `^`, a `)` no longer closes the block (E001, W001)
- A caret-joined FOR value that looks like `rem` still closes the list. The space on the line after `if^` is kept, so that line's `1==1 (` opens a block and its `)` is not a false E001. A `::` remark ending in `^` joins the next lines, as a label does: a `)` there no longer closes the block, and a `(` there does not open one

### Changed

- `BUILTIN_COMMANDS` lists stock cmd and Windows commands. Names such as `docker` are `COMMON_EXTERNAL_TOOLS`. A name in either set still suppresses E012 and E014 when a label has the same name
- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.70

## [1.1.69] - 2026-11-12

### Fixed

- A file without NUL bytes that decodes as UTF-8 is read as UTF-8, whatever charset_normalizer guesses. An ASCII script whose detection guesses `latin_1` no longer logs that it was read as `iso8859-1`. A file that is not valid UTF-8 is still reported with the encoding fallback warning

### Changed

- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.69

## [1.1.68] - 2026-11-05

### Fixed

- E009 reports an unmatched quote when a caret sits inside it, including `echo "^`. That caret does not continue the line, and `echo "hello^^` is unmatched as well. `echo "ok" ^` still joins and is not E009
- S018 uses the cmd label key. `call :ok.extra`, `call :paren(more)`, `call :entry` on `:entry rem text`, and `call :ok` on `:ok:extra` are subroutines that need a comment
- A label such as `:ok:extra`, `:ok.extra`, `:paren(more)`, or `:_` ends an embedded script block, so the label line is linted as batch. `goto _` finds `:_`, and `call :_` needs a subroutine comment

### Changed

- GitHub Actions pins record the full release in the comment, such as `# v7.0.1`. The commit SHA remains the pin
- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.68

## [1.1.67] - 2026-11-05

### Fixed

- Label lookup keys end at space, tab, `+`, `:`, `&`, `|`, `<`, and `>`. `goto :ok:extra` matches `:ok:other`, `goto plus+zzz` matches `:plus+more`, and `goto lab` matches `:lab&more`. Comma, semicolon, and equals stay in the label line's key, so `goto eq` does not match `:eq=more`
- A caret inside a REM remark does not join the next physical line, including `echo hi & rem note ^`. `echo rem note ^` still joins, and a label or `::` line that ends in an odd caret still joins
- A caret inside an unclosed double quote does not join the next physical line. `echo "note ^` leaves the following command in place, and E009 still reports the unclosed quote. A caret after a closed quote still joins
- `call)` is not the CALL keyword, so it does not affect S003 casing. `(call)` is CALL. `rem)` is a remark only when `)` closes a group that is already open, so `(rem) note` is not text after a group closer (E042). `(if)` and `if)` inside a group are E003
- A quoted `FOR /R` root such as `"D:\eol files"` is a path, not a FOR /F option string. `%%~qf` is not reported as an invalid percent-tilde parameter

### Changed

- Pinned batch-spec to v0.72.6. Quotes end at the physical line, a keyword immediately before `)` stays a keyword only when that `)` closes an open group, and FOR /F option strings apply only after `/F`
- Pinned batch-spec to v0.72.5. Label keys end at space, tab, plus, colon, and redirection operators, and a caret in a REM remark does not continue the line
- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.67

## [1.1.66] - 2026-11-05

### Changed

- PyPI publishing uses GitHub Trusted Publishing and attaches PEP 740 attestations. CI no longer uses a long-lived PyPI API token
- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.66

## [1.1.65] - 2026-11-05

### Changed

- The PyPI source distribution includes the test suite and `spec/corpus`, so a packager can run the tests with the `test` extra. Release scripts, installers, generators, benchmarks, and the cmd.exe oracle remain in the git checkout. Wheels still contain only the `blinter` package
- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.65

## [1.1.64] - 2026-11-05

### Fixed

- Files longer than 2500 lines still receive the security, warning, style, and unreachable-code checks. Parenthesis depth for unreachable code is computed once per file
- `CALL` of an external program is E014 only when that name is also a defined label. `SET /A` accepts a unary minus such as `5*-1`. `where deleted` is not SEC003, and `sc` inside another word is not SEC005. Command chaining after `2>&1` is still SEC013. SET /P dataflow (SEC001) runs even when the first line is skipped as an embedded header
- Label names end at whitespace and `+:=,;`, matching cmd.exe, so `goto start` reaches `:start rem entry`. `REM LINT:IGNORE-LINE` is recognized after `&` on the same line
- `--update-baseline` can record a finding on a blank line. Follow-calls rejects UNC paths before `Path.resolve`, and directory scans do not walk junctions or directory symlinks
- Text output strips terminal escape sequences. `--fail-on error` and `--follow-calls` help text matches the exit-code rules
- The Windows installer broadcasts a settings change after writing a `REG_EXPAND_SZ` user PATH. The uninstaller reads stop-script errors separately from process IDs. The quality gate requires Pester 5 or newer and reports PSScriptAnalyzer errors
- The cmd.exe oracle also refuses `format`, `diskpart`, `bcdedit`, `setx`, `schtasks`, and `reg add`. Nuitka toolchain downloads require `BLINTER_NUITKA_ALLOW_DOWNLOADS=1`
- On Windows, `scripts/verify.py` launches the lint benchmark through `runpy`, matching the regression test. Executing `scripts/benchmark_lint.py` as a script exceeds the committed CPU ceiling
- Child Python tools started by `scripts/verify.py` use UTF-8, so isort checks source files that contain characters outside the console code page
- `syntax/for-f-delims-only-valid` records the FOR /F rules that `delims=` must not raise. The conditional SETLOCAL fixture is no longer listed under pairing rules it does not assert

### Changed

- CodeRabbit reviews follow `.coderabbit.yaml`, including generated files, corpus fixtures, and the batch-spec submodule
- Contributor commands use `uv run` or an activated `.venv`. A bare `py` can import a different Blinter
- Script-structure analysis no longer returns delayed-expansion flags that no checker reads
- S003 command-start scanning lives in `parsing/command_scan.py`. Caret escapes are the one helper in `parsing/context.py`
- The optional `batch-script-examples` folder, its baseline check, and the `needs_corpus` tests are removed. Rule fixtures stay in `spec/corpus`
- `scripts/spec/cmd_oracle.py --case` runs one corpus case
- yamllint no longer checks YAML newlines. `.gitattributes` already stores YAML as LF, and a Windows `core.autocrlf` checkout is CRLF
- The synthetic and label benchmark medians are remeasured now that files over 2500 lines run the full checks. The ceiling remains twice the measured median
- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.64

## [1.1.63] - 2026-11-04

### Changed

- The install and uninstall script lint fails on every severity. A finding that should remain is suppressed on that line with `REM LINT:IGNORE`, or for both scripts with `disabled_rules` in `scripts/blinter.ini`. `where blinter` ignores W009 because that command is how the installer sees which copy PATH will run
- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.63

### Fixed

- W007 warns on `copy`, `move`, `del`, `erase`, `ren`, and `rename` of a path under `\Windows\`, `\System32\`, or `\Program Files`, including those directories written as `%WINDIR%`, `%SYSTEMROOT%`, or `%ProgramFiles%`. A user-profile `.exe` or `.dll`, including one the script has already stopped, is no longer a locked-file warning
- W067 still warns when `SET` replaces `PATH` or assigns another system variable such as `USERNAME`. `SET "PATH=%PATH%;directory"` keeps the existing search path. `SET "PATH=!PATH!;directory"` does too, while delayed expansion is enabled
  A `%PATH%` or `!PATH!` in a later command on the same line does not hide a replacement, and a later `SET` that does replace `PATH` still warns
  `SET /P` and `SET /A` still warn when the prompt or expression mentions `%PATH%`. `ECHO SET USERNAME=demo` is not an assignment. An `IF EXIST` operand such as `echo.txt` does not hide the `SET` after it. `SET "NOTE=Please set PATH=C:\Tools"` does not assign `PATH`
  `SET PATH="%PATH%";directory` still warns, because those quotes are part of the value. `FOR %%i in (1) do SET PATH=C:\only-this` still warns. `%PATH%suffix` still warns because it changes the last search directory
- P001 no longer pairs an `IF EXIST` with the `IF EXIST` on the other side of `ELSE`, including a check in the `ELSE` body and a check on the line after `ELSE (`. A closed `ELSE` block does not hide a later check of the same file
  A longer path, a different quoted path that shares a first word, or `ELSE IF EXIST` printed by `ECHO`, is not treated as the same file
- P016 warns when an executed `SET` inside a `FOR` loop reads the variable it assigns (`%NAME%`, `!NAME!`, or a substitution of that name) or repeats one `FOR` metavariable. `SET VALUE=%%a`, `SET VALUE=%OTHER%`, `ECHO SET result=!result!` and `REM SET result=!result!` are not concatenation
  An `IF EXIST` operand such as `echo.txt` does not hide a later `SET`. `SET result="!result!"` still warns
- P017 compares the full `IF EXIST` operand with other `IF EXIST` lines. `%DIR%` is not the same check as `%DIR%.zip` or `%DIR%\child`
- P022 warns for an unescaped `>nul` in a `FOR` body, including `for %%i in (1) do dir >nul`. A caret-escaped redirect or one inside the `IN` command, such as `in ('cmd /c echo 5 2^>nul')`, runs once and is not reported

## [1.1.62] - 2026-11-04

### Changed

- `scripts/blinter.ini` no longer disables rules. It only raises the line-length limit to 120 and hides the summary
- Install and uninstall PowerShell helpers run with `-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`. The batch file writes those helpers itself, so Bypass is not required
- The installer probes curl with `curl --version` before downloading
- The GitHub release `FOR /F` states that the helper's URL, tag, and digest are separated by spaces
- The version-probe temporary name uses `!RANDOM!` inside its parenthesized block
- The registry helpers split two lines that were longer than 120 characters, in both the PowerShell fixtures and the echo blocks
- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.62

### Fixed

- charset_normalizer's `utf_8` name is recognized as UTF-8. An ASCII script whose detection crosses the coherence threshold no longer logs that it was read as a non-UTF-8 encoding
- S010 no longer reports a label that execution falls through. The label is dead only when nothing names it with GOTO or CALL and no path falls into it, such as a label after a top-level EXIT or GOTO. `if ... goto` and `|| goto` still count as references
- A line ending in `^` is one command with the next physical line. `echo bye ^` followed by `exit` or `goto` does not leave. `echo hi & ^` followed by `exit` or `goto` does. An IF that continues onto `(` still owns that block
- S018 now asks for a parameter and return comment only on a label that an executable `call :name` invokes, including `call :name` after IF or `||`. A GOTO target or a fall-through label is not a subroutine. `call :name` on the continuation of `echo bye ^` is not a call; `call :name` after `echo hi & ^` is
- P008 no longer reports `!VAR!` below a block that runs ENDLOCAL and ends in EXIT or GOTO, nor below `if ... endlocal & exit /b`: those lines run only when the ENDLOCAL did not. Where a `setlocal disabledelayedexpansion` is open at such an ENDLOCAL, it now stays open below the block, so P008 can report `!VAR!` there
- P008 keeps that ENDLOCAL, as before, in the cases the docstrings of `_ExitScan` and `_build_delayed_expansion_state` in `src/blinter/parsing/structure.py` give, such as a block that holds a SETLOCAL or a GOTO before its last command, or a piped EXIT

## [1.1.61] - 2026-11-03

### Fixed

- S003 counts a keyword only where it reads the start of a command, so `dir SET a=1` and `dir ^& SET a=1` no longer count `SET`. Dropping keywords can change the majority casing
- For S003 a command starts after a separator, any unescaped parenthesis included, `ELSE`, `DO`, `<` or `2<`, an IF condition, `CALL`, `START` with its switches and its title, the first quoted word, and `cmd`, `%comspec%` or `!comspec!`, by name or path, quoted or not, with `/c`, `/k` or `/r`. A comma, semicolon or `=` standing alone before a command is skipped
- S003 reads `^&` and `^|` as separators in the command string of `cmd /c` or `FOR /F` and in an internal command that `START` runs, which a child cmd.exe runs, and glued switches such as `cmd /d/c` or `cmd /cset`, as cmd.exe does. There a `^)` closes a block opened in the string
- The string of `FOR /F` ends at the first unescaped `)` in its set for S003, even after an unescaped `(`
- After a line that ends in `^`, S003 reads the next line's first caret as escaped where that line starts with an odd run of carets and `&` or `|`, so it counts `SET` in `^& SET` and `^^^& SET`
- S003 now misses a command after `if (a b) == x`, `if 1==1(` or `if defined=x`, or after a `%debug%` prefix, among others. A word glued to `@`, as in `@SET`, is not counted, as before
- Where START runs cmd, S003 reads one child cmd.exe, not two, so it no longer counts `SET` in `start cmd /k dir ^^^| SET a=1`. A quoted word after START's title is the program. cmd without `/c`, `/k` or `/r` runs none of its words, as in `start /b cmd ^& SET a=1`
- S003 keeps the command string after a quoted cmd, so `"cmd.exe" /c "SET a=1"` counts `SET`. `"C:\x\app.exe" /c "SET a=1"` still does not

### Changed

- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.61

## [1.1.60] - 2026-11-03

### Fixed

- An `&` right after `>` or `<`, as in `2>&1`, `>&2` and `<&2`, belongs to the redirection and no longer splits the line into two commands. S010 now reports a label named only in ECHO text such as `echo see 2>&1 call :x`, and S015 and W004 no longer read `echo see 1>&2 goto x` as a GOTO. W071 no longer counts `>&2 echo %errorlevel%` in a block as two commands

### Changed

- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.60

## [1.1.59] - 2026-11-02

### Fixed

- S003 lets the search text of `%name:search=replace%` hold a `%` after its first character, so it counts `SET` in `set x=%p:a%"=Y% & SET q=1`, which cmd.exe runs whether `p` is defined or not. A quote in the replacement of such a token no longer hides a later command. A `%` right after the colon still ends the token, as in `%p:%"=Y%`

### Changed

- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.59

## [1.1.58] - 2026-11-02

### Fixed

- S003 took time quadratic in the number of double quotes on a line, because before each quote it searched the line from its start for `cmd /c`. On its own, S003 took about 0.1 seconds for 8,000 characters of `"a"` pairs and about 1.7 seconds for 32,000. It now takes linear time and returns the same findings

### Changed

- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.58

## [1.1.57] - 2026-11-02

### Fixed

- S003 treats an unclosed double quote as running to the end of the line, so `call :x "a & SET y=2` no longer counts `SET`. A quote in `%name:...%`, such as `set p=%p:"=% & SET q=1`, is not a quote: expanding a defined variable removes it, along with the search text of `%name:search=replace%`; a quote in the replacement stays. Names may hold spaces
- S003 no longer lets a quote inside a finished `%name%` token hide a later command. That includes a quote written with `%%`, as in `%p:%%"=Y%`. A `%` still ends the token, so the quote in `%p:%"=Y%` stays and that later command is not counted

### Changed

- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.57

## [1.1.56] - 2026-11-01

### Fixed

- S010 reports no label a computed jump can reach: every label for `goto %ACTION%` or `call :%~1`, and those starting with `case_` for `goto case_%1`
- S010 still sees that jump after nested `IF` predicates and after `@`, and reads a `FOR` command from the `DO` after the input set. A `goto %` on a label line, or a `do` inside the set, does not hide other labels

### Changed

- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.56

## [1.1.55] - 2026-11-01

### Fixed

- S003 and W021 took time quadratic in the length of a run of spaces, such as `x &` followed by thousands of spaces, because their regular expressions rescanned the run from every space in it. S003 took about 7 seconds for 8,000 spaces. On long runs of spaces, both now run in linear time and return the same findings

### Changed

- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.55

## [1.1.54] - 2026-10-31

### Added

- `pymarkdownlnt` checks every Markdown file in the repository as part of `scripts/verify.py`

### Fixed

- P008, W022 and E006 ignore a `!VAR!` on a comment line
- S003 ignores double-quoted text, such as a PowerShell `-Command` argument, and a comment after a command separator
- W022 no longer treats SETLOCAL EnableDelayedExpansion as present when it appears only in a comment, an ECHO line, or a REM after a separator
- S003 still sees commands inside `cmd /c` and `cmd /k` strings, a caret-escaped quote does not hide the command between the quotes, and a comment after an even number of carets (`^^&`) is still a comment

### Changed

- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.54

## [1.1.53] - 2026-10-31

### Fixed

- S026 ignores a caret on a comment line or inside double quotes, such as a `findstr` pattern

### Changed

- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.53

## [1.1.52] - 2026-10-30

### Fixed

- W001 no longer treats a command whose name merely begins with `rem` (for example `remote.exe`) as a comment, so a script that ends on such a command is flagged for a missing exit code.
  Every checker now shares one comment test that accepts only `REM`, `@REM`, a lone `REM` and `::`, in any letter case.
  Several checkers previously missed `@REM`, a bare `REM`, or an upper-case `REM`
- The FOR-block scan behind the loop-scoped performance rules ignores parentheses inside quotes and after a caret, and its cache is reset at the start of every lint pass
- Several rules took seconds to minutes on long pathological lines because of nested wildcards in their regular expressions (the `%a%` pattern, the `>echo` command-injection pattern with its trailing space, FOR /F quoting in E047, the SEC009 and SEC022 to SEC024 patterns and others). They now run in linear time and return the same findings
- P010 flags DIR only when its output is piped or redirected to standard output and `/B` is absent, as the rule describes. It previously fired on any DIR line and suggested a `/F` switch that DIR does not have
- S008 accepts a comment directly above a block, W025 accepts `command || exit /b` on the same line, and W033 no longer reports a quoted CALL target that carries an extension
- The SARIF log reports `executionSuccessful: false` when a file could not be linted
- Standard output falls back to UTF-8 on consoles whose code page cannot encode the report, and the `--max-line-length` usage message is printed when the value is rejected
- `uninstall_blinter.cmd` removes only the exact Blinter entry from the user PATH. A directory name that merely contained the bin path, or a path with square brackets, was previously mishandled
- `scripts/verify.py` stops with a clear message when it runs on a non-CPython interpreter, because mypy does not support PyPy
- The lint-time scaling tests re-measure a failing comparison before reporting it, so a single scheduler stall on a shared runner (seen on `macos-15-intel`) no longer fails the build, while a real super-linear slowdown still fails every attempt.
  The build-script tests no longer share the generated `_build_version.py` file, which made them fail intermittently when run in parallel

### Changed

- A manual run of the release workflow now needs the `confirm_release` input when the version tag already exists, and it only replaces release assets when the tag points at the commit being built. The PyPI upload skips files that already exist, so a confirmed re-publish does not fail there. Release notes are extracted for the exact version being published
- The `dependency-graph` job no longer blocks the release version check
- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.52
- The documentation describes the exit codes, `--follow-calls`, `--fail-on`, `min_severity` and the SARIF semantics, and the package `Documentation` URL points at the project docs

### Added

- A negative corpus case for 120 rules that had none. `scripts/spec/audit_ssot.py` now fails when a rule has no case listing it in `must_not`, and the reference-matrix counts a `must_not` assertion as covering a construct. The corpus holds 417 cases

## [1.1.51] - 2026-10-29

### Changed

- `install_blinter.cmd` no longer needs an architecture. With no argument it installs the native build, and `x64` or `arm64` is an optional override. An unrecognized argument still downloads nothing, and `arm64` is still refused on a non-ARM64 PC
- PSScriptAnalyzer and Pester now find every PowerShell file under `scripts/` and `tests/` on their own. This brought the previously unchecked `InstallerPs.Helpers.ps1` and `TestInstallerPs.Tests.ps1` under lint, and their findings are fixed
- The PowerShell that `scripts/verify.py` ran as inline strings is now `scripts/verify_ps/*.ps1`, with Pester tests. The Unix installer test stand-ins for `curl`, `uname`, `id`, `getconf`, `sysctl` and `chmod` moved from Python strings to `tests/unix_stubs/`, where ShellCheck lints them
- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.51

### Added

- `scripts/install_blinter.sh` and `scripts/uninstall_blinter.sh` install and remove the standalone executable on Linux and macOS.
  The installer picks the native build, accepts an optional `x64` or `arm64` argument to override it, verifies the archive against the release `SHA256SUMS`, installs to `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/blinter/bin`, and adds a marked PATH block to the shell startup files, which the uninstaller removes
- ShellCheck lints the shell scripts through `scripts/verify.py`, and the `quality-unix` CI job installs and uninstalls the real release on Linux and macOS, x64 and arm64
- `scripts/installer_ps/Write-CrlfScriptCopy.ps1` mirrors the line-ending bootstrap embedded in `install_blinter.cmd` and `uninstall_blinter.cmd`, so it is linted and covered by the batch parity checks like the other embedded PowerShell

## [1.1.50] - 2026-10-29

### Added

- Linux and macOS standalone executables. Releases include `Blinter-v1.1.50-Linux-x64.tar.gz`, `Blinter-v1.1.50-Linux-arm64.tar.gz`, `Blinter-v1.1.50-macOS-arm64.tar.gz`, and `Blinter-v1.1.50-macOS-x64.tar.gz`.
  Each archive contains a folder of the same name and a `blinter` binary.
  Linux binaries need glibc 2.39 or newer (Ubuntu 24.04 and newer). macOS binaries target macOS 15 on arm64 and x64 and are not notarized
- `SHA256SUMS` lists the SHA-256 digest of every release archive

### Changed

- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.50

## [1.1.49] - 2026-10-24

### Changed

- `install_blinter.cmd` downloads only `Blinter-<tag>-Windows-<arch>.zip` and expects `Blinter-<tag>-Windows-<arch>\blinter.exe`
- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.49

## [1.1.48] - 2026-10-24

### Added

- `yamllint` checks every YAML file in the repository as part of `scripts/verify.py`

### Fixed

- The install benchmark workflow checks out the repository, uses the matrix Python, and can upload artifacts. Release zips are verified and extracted with the same `Blinter-<tag>-Windows-<arch>/blinter.exe` layout as the installer
- A version already recorded in `pyproject.toml` still releases when its git tag does not exist, so a red release run can publish on the next green push

### Changed

- Windows release archives are `Blinter-v<version>-Windows-x64.zip` and `Blinter-v<version>-Windows-arm64.zip`. Each zip contains a folder of the same name, and `install_blinter.cmd` downloads that asset
- Until a Windows-named archive is the latest release, `install_blinter.cmd` also accepts the previous `Blinter-<tag>-<arch>.zip` name and folder. That fallback is removed in the next release
- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.48

## [1.1.47] - 2026-10-22

### Changed

- The installer accepts only `Blinter-<tag>-<arch>\blinter.exe` and no longer searches the archive for `blinter.exe`
- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.47

## [1.1.46] - 2026-10-22

### Changed

- `install_blinter.cmd` requires `x64` or `arm64`. With no argument, or any other argument, it downloads nothing. `arm64` is refused on a non-ARM64 PC. On ARM64, `x64` is allowed and the installer notes that `arm64` is the native build
- Each release zip contains a folder with the same name: `Blinter-v1.1.46-x64\blinter.exe` and `Blinter-v1.1.46-arm64\blinter.exe`
- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.46

## [1.1.45] - 2026-10-22

### Added

- Native Windows ARM64 `blinter.exe`, built and smoke-tested on `windows-11-arm`. Releases include `Blinter-v1.1.45-x64.zip` and `Blinter-v1.1.45-arm64.zip`

### Changed

- Nuitka builds no longer pass the default `--file-reference-choice=runtime` or a second `--include-package=blinter`. MSVC builds pass `--include-windows-runtime-dlls=yes` so a missing Visual Studio redistributable fails the build
- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.45

## [1.1.44] - 2026-10-21

### Added

- `--baseline` and `--update-baseline` record accepted findings and fail on a new finding or on a recorded one that no longer matches (#50)

### Fixed

- SEC012 no longer flags `REM` and `::` comments that mention a temporary path (#46)
- SEC013 no longer treats the first variable in a `FOR` set as a command (#47)
- `LINT:IGNORE` matches case-insensitively in ASCII only, so look-alike letters such as `ı` and `ſ` do not suppress rules (#48)
- Lines split only at LF, and a lone CR is dropped, matching cmd.exe (#49)

### Changed

- Pinned batch-spec to v0.72.4. A CR that is not part of CRLF is not a line break, and a caret plus CRLF stays one escaped ending
- The MegaLinter install pin is 1.1.44
- `scripts/verify.py` is the quality gate for local runs and CI.
  mypy and pylint check `src`, `scripts`, and `tests` from their config instead of a hand-maintained file list.
  bandit checks `src` and `scripts`. `--windows-only` replaces `--powershell-only` and includes the cmd.exe corpus oracle.
  `--skip-pytest` leaves the test suite to CI's matrix job.
  On Python 3.15, pylint runs in one process because parallel jobs crash while pickling the linter.

## [1.1.43] - 2026-10-19

### Added

- MegaLinter plugin descriptor for `.bat` and `.cmd` files (`mega-linter-plugin-blinter/blinter.megalinter-descriptor.yml`)
- `--fail-on` and the `fail_on` configuration key choose which severity exits 1. The default remains `security`

### Fixed

- The installer check accepts `blinter --version` output that names the standalone executable or the Python version and package directory
- `--follow-calls` walks each script's CALL list once, so cycles no longer re-expand until the depth limit
- E001, E002, E028, E033, E042, E045, and SEC013 no longer flag parenthesized command groups, dynamic `GOTO`/`CALL` parameters, empty `""` arguments, substring and replacement expansions, `PROGRAMFILES(X86)`, piped commands, or quoted variables next to operators
- A configuration file with a UTF-8 BOM is read, and a file that cannot be parsed or has an invalid boolean or integer names the file and key instead of falling back to defaults
- Long `IF` lines with many `&&` separators are checked in linear time

### Changed

- Pinned batch-spec to v0.72.3 (tooling and docs only; grammar and command catalogs unchanged)
- Package classifiers drop the Windows-only operating system entry and the code-generator topic
- `uv.lock` is tracked, and CI runs `uv lock --check`
- The SSOT audit `--check` mode fails when the tracked baseline would change
- Version lookup uses `pyproject.toml` only for a `src/` checkout named Blinter; otherwise it uses installed package metadata
- The README install and uninstall one-liners and the MegaLinter pin use v1.1.43

## [1.1.42] - 2026-10-15

### Fixed

- Command-casing checks no longer backtrack on long runs of spaces, and large files no longer rebuild delayed-expansion or label-block state for every line
- `CALL` targets that use backslashes resolve on Linux and macOS
- An explicit `--config` path that is missing or has an invalid `max_line_length` or `min_severity` fails instead of continuing with defaults
- Lines longer than 10,000 characters are reported and skipped so the rest of the file is still linted. A line over 1,000,000 characters still rejects the file
- The large-file size warning prints one decimal place
- The installer no longer deletes `blinter.exe` before a download succeeds, and an up-to-date marker is ignored when that executable is missing or will not run
- The uninstaller reads `!errorlevel!` inside parenthesized blocks and stops only its own `blinter.exe`
- Installer PowerShell reads paths from the environment and writes `REG_EXPAND_SZ` user `PATH` values back unexpanded

### Added

- E048 flags a line that exceeds the maximum length the linter will fully parse
- W071 flags parse-time `%errorlevel%`, `%random%`, `%time%`, and `%date%` inside a parenthesized block when that use is stale
- `blinter --version` names the standalone executable or the Python version and package directory
- The installer warns when another `blinter` is earlier on `PATH`
- Release jobs attest the Windows zip and the Python distributions

### Changed

- Package metadata accepts `charset-normalizer>=3.5.2,<4`. The Windows executable build still pins `charset-normalizer==3.5.2`
- Nuitka and setuptools are pinned in CI
- The README install and uninstall one-liners download the v1.1.42 scripts with `curl -fL --proto =https`
- Pinned batch-spec to v0.72.2

## [1.1.41] - 2026-10-15

### Changed

- `charset-normalizer` is pinned to 3.5.2 in package metadata and `requirements.txt`

## [1.1.40] - 2026-10-15

### Changed

- Package metadata requires Python `>=3.11,<3.16`, so installers skip Python 3.16 until that version is supported

## [1.1.39] - 2026-10-14

### Added

- Python 3.15 is supported. CI tests Python 3.11–3.15 on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows, and the package classifiers list 3.15

### Fixed

- The Windows installer writes a SHA256 verifier that cmd does not cut short. Closing parentheses and the caret in the `sha256:` prefix are escaped, so a matching archive still verifies

### Changed

- Windows CI runs the installer and uninstaller, including Unix line endings. An elevated runner starts those scripts as a basic user

## [1.1.38] - 2026-10-14

### Changed

- Wheels and source distributions are built with uv_build. `docs/Architecture.md` and `docs/Batch-File-Linter-Requirements.md` stay in the repository and are no longer installed into `share/doc/blinter`

## [1.1.37] - 2026-10-14

### Added

- `--format sarif` emits a SARIF 2.1.0 report for GitHub Code Scanning and other SARIF consumers. Rule codes become rule IDs, and Error/Security, Warning, and Style/Performance map to SARIF levels `error`, `warning`, and `note`

### Changed

- Pinned batch-spec language SSOT to v0.72.1 (release tooling and docs; grammar and command catalogs are unchanged)

## [1.1.36] - 2026-10-14

### Fixed

- **E003** checks only the IF condition, so a valid line such as `if "%1"=="" set X=1` or `if ... echo a = b` is no longer a fatal error
- `--format json` keeps skipped-file details in the JSON report. When every file is skipped, stdout is still JSON
- **S028** leaves parentheses in place when the group chains commands with `&` or `|`
- **P022** and **P023** apply only inside a FOR block, including a one-line `for ... do`
- **W004** allows the usual `shift` loop that exits when the next argument is empty
- **P006** no longer requires ENDLOCAL before a top-level `exit /b`. Ending the batch file ends SETLOCAL
- A UTF-16 BOM is decoded as UTF-16. NUL bytes that are not valid UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32 raise one encoding error instead of being read as cp1252
- Directory scans accept `.BAT` and `.CMD` on case-sensitive filesystems
- Piping output to a program that closes the pipe exits quietly
- The installer treats a PATH entry as present only when the segment matches exactly

### Changed

- CALL and GOTO checks remember the first line that targets each label, and sort label definitions once per file
- The performance gate uses the current synthetic timing and a second file with 2000 labels and unique CALL targets. A case fails when it takes more than twice that median
- Source distributions omit the `tests/` tree. Tests run from a git checkout
- GitHub Actions are pinned to commit SHAs, and PyPI publishing pins Twine 7.0.0
- Changelog links point at `BatchLang/Blinter`

## [1.1.35] - 2026-10-13

### Changed

- Pinned batch-spec language SSOT to v0.72.0 (standalone `{` `}` `[` `]` tokens; apostrophes do not pair across lines)

## [1.1.34] - 2026-10-12

### Changed

- FOR-block performance checks scan each file once instead of from line 1 on every line, so medium scripts no longer pay a quadratic cost
- **W068** compiles each variable's percent-expansion pattern once and matches the SET name once per command segment. Reported issues are unchanged

## [1.1.33] - 2026-10-12

### Changed

- The `_build_version.pyi` type stub stays in the repository for type checking and is excluded from the wheel. It is not used at runtime

## [1.1.32] - 2026-10-12

### Changed

- Standalone `blinter.exe` compiles its version from `pyproject.toml` at build time. It no longer unpacks a bundled `pyproject.toml` to answer `--version`
- The generated version module is removed after the Nuitka compile, so a later wheel build does not ship it. pip installs still take the version from package metadata

## [1.1.31] - 2026-09-22

### Changed

- Canonical repository, installer, and security contact are the [BatchLang organization](https://github.com/BatchLang/Blinter) and BatchLang@proton.me
- Standalone `blinter.exe` reports company BatchLang and extracts native files to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BatchLang\Blinter\<version>`

## [1.1.30] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- **W063** scopes FOR /F token overflow to the current loop: nested `FOR /F` (including `@` and `IF EXIST` prefixes) is not treated as outer overflow, `echo (` does not swallow the next line, and `DO` inside `IN (...)` is not the loop body
- **W049** still warns when SET assigns a space-only value to a pseudo-environment variable; `SET "errorlevel="` remains a valid clear

### Changed

- Parenthesis-depth and empty-assignment caches live in parsing with identity-safe keys, so large scripts lint without quadratic scans and without a checkers/parsing import cycle
- Coverage, mypy, pylint (`fail-under=10`), and pytest configs drop unused boilerplate; coverage still maps installed `site-packages/blinter` into `src/blinter`

## [1.1.29] - 2026-09-20

### Changed

- Windows `blinter.exe` Nuitka builds install `charset-normalizer` as pure Python and nofollow unused `ssl`/`socket`/`wmi` extensions so fewer CPython `.pyd` files unpack at runtime
- Architecture docs cover the x64 onefile extract layout; the README still warns that antivirus may false-positive the standalone exe

## [1.1.28] - 2026-09-17

### Added

- Fifteen cmd.exe rules (E043–E047, SEC025, W064–W070, S029–S030) covering `::` inside blocks, ELSE on a new line, invalid FOR/IF switches, spaced `2> &1`, unescaped FOR /F specials, unquoted `%CD%`, IF wildcards, parse-time `%var%` after SET in a block, `%TIME%` space padding, and SET/PATH/PROMPT `&&` in `.bat` files
- Corpus fixtures for those rules (274 committed cases)

### Fixed

- **E046** flags only a space before `&` in stream merges (`2> &1`); `2>>&1` is valid append-duplication on live cmd
- **W017** also flags `IF ERRORLEVEL 0` (always true for non-negative codes)
- **E036** also flags `IF EXIT` / `IF EXITS` misspellings of EXIST
- **E003** flags a single `=` in IF and a missing space before `(`
- **W044** flags `SET` with a space before `=` even without a space after
- **SEC001** / **SEC014** retargeted to unquoted SET /P dataflow and unquoted arguments

### Changed

- Pinned batch-spec language SSOT to v0.71.0 (EXIST misspellings, single-equals IF, unknown FOR switches, spaced handle duplication)
- Spec docs, Architecture, and funding metadata match the 274-case corpus; synthetic lint baseline is 25.0s for the extra cmd.exe checks

## [1.1.27] - 2026-09-09

### Added

- uv support for install (`uv tool install Blinter`, `uvx blinter`) and development (`uv sync --extra dev`); CI Python installs use uv. pip remains a first-class path.

## [1.1.26] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- **W036** reads a FOR /F command operand to the parenthesis that balances `IN (`, so nested `(` inside a backquoted command is not treated as a file ([#37](https://github.com/BatchLang/Blinter/issues/37), [#42](https://github.com/BatchLang/Blinter/pull/42))
- Drive-relative names such as `C:Set-Permissions` and `ForEach-Object.bat` are no longer classified as embedded PowerShell ([#38](https://github.com/BatchLang/Blinter/issues/38), [#42](https://github.com/BatchLang/Blinter/pull/42))
- **S010** ignores `CALL`/`GOTO` inside an inline `REM` or `ECHO` segment after `&` ([#39](https://github.com/BatchLang/Blinter/issues/39), [#42](https://github.com/BatchLang/Blinter/pull/42))
- **P024**/**P006** count `SETLOCAL`/`ENDLOCAL` after an `IF` predicate or `&` ([#40](https://github.com/BatchLang/Blinter/issues/40), [#42](https://github.com/BatchLang/Blinter/pull/42))

### Changed

- Pinned batch-spec language SSOT to v0.70.1 (FOR /F usebackq backtick commands keep nested parentheses as data)
- Spec docs, Architecture, and funding metadata match the 235-case corpus

## [1.1.25] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- PowerShell `Get-`/`Set-`/`Write-`/`New-` detection no longer backtracks into hyphenated filenames, and ignores `.psm1`/`.psd1`/`.ps1xml` script modules the same way as `.ps1`
- **P024** reports only a second real `SETLOCAL`; extra `ENDLOCAL` is left to its own rules

## [1.1.24] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- **P024** and **P006** no longer treat the word `setlocal`/`endlocal` inside comments as commands, and P024 reports the second real `SETLOCAL` ([#40](https://github.com/BatchLang/Blinter/issues/40))
- **S010** counts labels reached by `if ... goto`/`call` and `|| goto`, while ignoring `goto`/`call` inside comments or echo output ([#39](https://github.com/BatchLang/Blinter/issues/39))
- Hyphenated filenames such as `set-permissions.bat` are no longer classified as embedded PowerShell, so per-line rules still run ([#38](https://github.com/BatchLang/Blinter/issues/38))
- **W036** no longer treats FOR /F command operands (for example `powershell -NoProfile` under usebackq backticks) as data files ([#37](https://github.com/BatchLang/Blinter/issues/37))

### Changed

- Spec docs, Architecture, and funding metadata match the 231-case corpus

## [1.1.23] - 2026-09-07

### Changed

- Windows `blinter.exe` Nuitka build uses LTO, cached onefile extract, stripped docstrings/asserts, and unused-stdlib nofollow; UPX stays off

## [1.1.22] - 2026-09-07

### Changed

- Windows standalone `blinter.exe` is now built with Nuitka (`scripts/build_exe.py`) instead of PyInstaller

### Fixed

- Frozen `blinter.exe --version` reads the bundled `pyproject.toml` from the Nuitka extract layout

## [1.1.21] - 2026-08-31

### Changed

- Pinned batch-spec language SSOT to v0.70.0 (unquoted `)` inside a command group closes the group; leftover text is a syntax error)

## [1.1.20] - 2026-08-30

### Added

- **E042** detects text after a closing parenthesis inside a parenthesized IF/FOR/(group) block, a fatal cmd.exe parse error (fixes [#36](https://github.com/BatchLang/Blinter/issues/36))

### Changed

- Spec docs, Architecture, and funding metadata match the 226-case corpus and 176 rules

## [1.1.19] - 2026-08-29

### Fixed

- Embedded C#/JScript/VBScript skip detection: in-file JScript polyglots, tighter VBScript and C# starters, and `if`/`for` inside those blocks no longer close the skip region (`echo`-to-temp payloads and `cscript`/`wscript` invocations stay linted)

### Added

- SSOT corpus fixtures for embedded skip behavior (`embedded-csharp-skip`, `embedded-jscript-skip`, `embedded-vbscript-skip`)

### Changed

- Spec docs, Architecture, and funding metadata match the 222-case corpus
- Installer Pester tests exercise PATH update/remove, archive expand, and download-size fixtures without mutating the real User PATH

## [1.1.18] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- Standalone installer verifies the GitHub release zip SHA256 before extracting
- Compatibility and Unicode warning checks live in `warnings_compat` (W009, W010, W011, W027, W029)

### Fixed

- Installer SHA256 verification hashes with .NET so it works when Windows PowerShell inherits pwsh's `PSModulePath` (GitHub Actions Windows jobs)

### Changed

- Windows CI runs the cmd.exe corpus oracle; the Linux quality job validates the spec corpus
- cmd.exe oracle executes read-only WMIC queries (still present on Windows 10); interactive or mutating WMIC remains skipped
- Spec docs, Architecture, and funding metadata match the 219-case corpus and batch-spec lock v0.69.2
- README documents large-file handling as a 10MB warning and 50MB reject
- Removed unused SST experiment scripts (`port_rule_impl.py`, `compare_patterns.py`, `experiment_benchmark.py`)

## [1.1.17] - 2026-08-13

### Changed

- CI and release are a single Test workflow: CodeQL, dependency graph submission, and PyPI/GitHub release run in one pipeline with explicit `needs` dependencies (no `workflow_run` chaining)
- CodeQL analysis runs in CI for Python and GitHub Actions workflow files; GitHub default CodeQL setup must remain disabled (Settings > Code security)

## [1.1.16] - 2026-08-13

### Changed

- Build-Release-PYPI gated release on Test, CodeQL, and Dependency Graph (superseded by unified Test workflow pipeline)

## [1.1.15] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- **W004** only flags backward `goto` jumps (forward exit-handler jumps no longer reported as infinite loops)
- **W043** accepts `tasklist` verification on preceding lines in the same block, not only on the `taskkill` line
- **W014** ignores `set /p VAR=<file` file-input redirection and treats `timeout /t` as an alternative to `pause`
- **P006** skips `exit /b` returns from `call :subroutine` labels
- **SEC013** adds safe patterns for installer-style PowerShell `-File`, quoted executable redirection, and `curl` output
- **W020** and **P009** treat `delims=` as a valid `FOR /F` option for whole-line capture

### Changed

- `scripts/blinter.ini` installer profile shrinks from 21 to 10 disabled rules now that false positives are resolved
- Install and uninstall scripts include clearer comments for resume paths and user-facing messages

### Added

- SSOT corpus negative controls for the fixed rules (`w004-goto-exit-handler`, `w043-tasklist-before-taskkill`, `w014-setp-from-file-valid`, `p006-subroutine-exit-valid`, `sec013-installer-redirection-valid`, `for-f-delims-only-valid`, `p009-w020-for-f-missing-options`)

## [1.1.14] - 2026-08-13

### Changed

- README badge formatting updated from paragraph to `div` layout for presentation consistency

## [1.1.13] - 2026-08-13

### Changed

- README documents batch compatibility and encoding detection behavior more clearly
- PyPI download badges and license text formatting improved in README
- Minor formatting adjustments in `Blinter.spec`

## [1.1.12] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- OpenSSF Best Practices compliance files and README badges
- Dependabot configuration for pip and GitHub Actions updates
- `scripts/extract_release_notes.py` for release workflow changelog extraction

### Changed

- `CHANGELOG.md` moved to the repository root for OpenSSF detection

### Fixed

- `types-pyyaml` entry corrected in `requirements-dev.txt`
- Import order in `extract_release_notes.py` (isort)

## [1.1.11] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- SSOT audit strict-mode failures for E038, E019, and E008 negative-control corpus fixtures
- Black formatting in `tests/test_edge_cases.py`

## [1.1.10] - 2026-08-13

### Changed

- CI and quality-gate improvements

## [1.1.9] - 2026-08-12

### Changed

- Continued rule and corpus hardening

## [1.1.8] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- Application icon in the Windows executable build (`Blinter.spec`)
- Tests for icon configuration in the spec file

### Changed

- README updated for versioned standalone download naming

## [1.1.7] - 2026-08-11

### Changed

- Rule registry and checker refinements

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Major 1.1 release line with expanded rule coverage and SSOT-driven rule generation
